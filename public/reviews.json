      "description": "If you are looking for an free effective cheat that will help you in all possible situations no matter what server you are playing on, Raven XD is the solution you are looking for. Raven XD has become the client of choice to test the AntiCheats of the servers I own, or to go and have fun with friends on community servers to make 12 year olds rage that show their moms that they love ButterFlyClick. Anyway, on many servers, even with settings set to the extreme, Raven XD knows how to be discreet, while having a clear advantage against the opponents encountered. In short, you need a powerful cheat? Take Raven XD."

      "description": "This fork has great bypasses, and in my own opinion it is better than Bs by a lot lol. This client has an option to post recommendations to be reviewed by staff and it actually might added. For myself, I had a ton of fun on hypixel and blocksmc using this client, but it isn‚Äôt perfect. It doesn‚Äôt have god bypasses for some anticheats like intave and MAINLY focuses on servers like hypixel and blocksmc. Aside from that it still is a good multi server and does bypasses every ac if you think of it. Aim assist and auto clicker never flagged for me before. I just need a silent aura!!!!! Yeah it‚Äôs good."

      "description": "honestly the autoclicker jitter and the legit modes on the features is pretty useful to make everything seem like your not hacking but you actually are but pretending to be legit. not much clients have configs too, or as in the client way, profiles, which is also a good thing knowing you can share your profiles to other people that is effective and bypasses anticheats, and yk, it has minigames like bedwars and etc and it gives you useful stats for when you know someone has bought armor and holding something like fireball so you know you risk something if you go near these people so i think overall that as in free, this is the best client you could use for stuff like looking legit, or maybe if you want to use known features from some clients in one like profiles aka configs, aim assist, autoclicker, etc. its very good tbh, and plus it works in forge so i can put other mods together with it to make the experience even better, so i really liked it"
